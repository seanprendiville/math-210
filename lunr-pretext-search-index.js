Upper\/lower bound  We say that is an upper bound for the set if  is a lower bound for if  is an upper\/lower bound for the function if it is an upper\/lower bound for the image set (The notation \" \" should be read as \" defined to equal \".)     If then 3 is an upper bound for . We must check that for every we have . The only elements of are 1 and 2, and both of the inequalities and hold. We have therefore verified that the defining condition of being an upper bound holds.   If then 1 is an upper bound for . We have and . So for all we have .   If then 0 is a lower bound for . If then by definition .   If then is not an upper bound for . Negating the definition of being an upper bound, we must show that for we have This holds since, for instance, satisfies .      Define what it means for a set\/function to be bounded above, bounded below and bounded .   Bounded above\/below  We say that a set is bounded above if it has an upper bound, that is Similarly, a function is bounded above if it has an upper bound, that is A set\/function is bounded below if it has a lower bound.  A set\/function is bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below. For sets, this is equivalent to: For functions, this is equivalent to:     Supremum and infimum Define what it means to be a supremum or infimum for a set of real numbers.   Supremum   is a supremum for if is an upper bound for and any any other upper bound for is larger, so that .   In other words, is the least upper bound for , and we denote this quantity (if it exists).   Infimum   is an infimum for if is a lower bound for and any any other lower bound for is smaller, so that .   In other words, is the greatest lower bound for , and we denote this quantity (if it exists).      3 is an upper bound for . We must show it is the least upper bound. Suppose that is another upper bound for . Then by definition of being an upper bound and the fact that 3 lies in our set, we have that . Thus 3 is smaller than any other upper bound, thereby satisfies the definition ( ) of being a supremum.     By definition , so 1 is certainly an upper bound for the set. It remains to show that 1 is the smallest upper bound. To this end, suppose that is another upper bound for . Notice that if , then any element strictly between and 1 (for instance the midpoint will be an element of which exceeds the upper bound (a contradiction). Therefore we must have , so that 1 is the least upper bound (as claimed).  Notice that this example shows that the supremum does not always lie in the set . When the supremum lies in the set we call it the maximum (see ).    does not exist. Every is an upper bound for , since the negation does not hold (we say that a statement of the form is true \"vacuously\", since the negation cannot hold due to there being no elements in the empty set). No real can be the least upper bound for the empty set, since is a smaller upper bound. This means that we can only take the supremum of a non-empty set .   If is not bounded above (for instance ) then has no upper bound, in particular no least upper bound. Thus does not exist.  This means that we can only take the supremum of a set which is bounded above .  The completeness principle ( ) says that if is non-empty and bounded above, then exists.      Given a function , define the notation and (when these quantities exist).  Given a function and a set we write This supremum exists if and only if is bounded above on and is non-empty.  We write This infimum exists if and only if is bounded below on and is non-empty.  State and prove how decreasing a supremum gives a non-upper bound.   Decreasing a sup gives a non-upper bound  Let be non-empty and bounded above. Then   Let be arbitrary; we are required to find such that . Aiming for a contradiction, let us suppose that this does not hold, so that for all we have . But then is an upper bound for which is strictly smaller than . Since is the smallest upper bound for , we have obtained our desired contradiction.    Maximum and minimum Define the maximum and minimum for a set of real numbers (when these quantities exist).   Maximum  We say that a set of real numbers has a maximum if exists and . In this situation, we write for and call it the maximum .    Minimum  We say that a set of real numbers has a minimum if exists and . In this situation, we write for and call it the minimum .      .   does not exist.  For any finite non-empty set, both and exist.    Define the maximum and minimum for a real-valued function (when these quantities exist).  Given a set , we write provided that this quantity exists (i.e. provided that the set has a supremum which belongs to the set).  Similarly, we write provided that this quantity exists.     Self-test questions for lecture 2  Completeness principle State (but don't prove) the \" completeness principle \" for the real numbers.   The completeness principle  Suppose that a set of real numbers is  non-empty  bounded above,  then has a supremum, .  In other words, any set with an upper bound has a least upper bound (provided that the set is non-empty).   NON-EXAMINABLE . The proof depends on how one constructs the real numbers, of which there are many alternative constructions (e.g. Dedekind cuts of rationals, decimal expansions, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences, etc). See en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers .   In this course, the completeness principle is the main result we use (repeatedly, sometimes in a hidden manner) in order to show that certain limits exist. For instance all of the following involve a limit in their construction, and the existence of this limit is guaranteed (under certain conditions) by the completeness principle:   The completeness principle is equivalent to the following statement involving the infimum :  Suppose that a set of real numbers is  non-empty  bounded below,  then has an infimum, .  In other words, any set with a lower bound has a greatest lower bound (provided that the set is non-empty).  The second statement can be derived from the first by reflecting the set through zero to obtain , then observing that .   As an example of how the completeness principle can be used, we outline how to construct a square-root of two from the rational numbers.  First observe that the set is bounded above (e.g. by 100) and non-empty (e.g. it contains 1). Hence by the completeness principle, it has a supremum We leave it as an exercise for the enthusiastic reader to demonstrate that , so that is a square-root of two.    Sequences Define what it means to be a sequence of real numbers.  A sequence of real numbers is a function .   Rather than using function notation , we usually write a sequence as where .  We may also write or or simply . We may also change the starting point of the sequence, for instance: or , etc.   State what it means for a sequence to be in a set of real numbers.  Given , we say that a sequence is in  if for all we have .  Define the \" th term \" of a sequence.  The \" th term \" of the sequence is the number .  Give some examples and non-examples of sequences. In particular, give an example of a function and a set which are not sequences (i.e. demonstrate your knowledge of the difference between a set, a function and a sequence).  Some examples of sequences include:  The enumeration of the even numbers in increasing order .  An enumeration of the even numbers in a different order . Notice that this is a different sequence to our first example, since they have different 1st term. The order of a sequence matters.  A constant sequence, consisting of the same real number repeated at every term, e.g. , so that for all .  The sequence of values of the function evaluated at positive integers .    Some non-examples of sequences include:  The sine function . The problem is that the domain of this function is not a countable set.  The set of even numbers . The problem here is that there is no ordering associated with a set. It is not clear what the th term of a set is.  The set . For a sequence, different terms may take the same value . It makes sense to say that the value occurs infinitely often in a sequence. However, there are no repetitions of elements in a set: an element either belongs once or not at all.     Convergent sequences Define what it means for a sequence of real numbers to converge to a real limit.   Limit of convergent sequence We say that a sequence of real numbers  converges to , and write as or , if     Typically, one takes to be a positive integer, so denotes the th term of the sequence, after which all remaining terms of the sequence lie in the \" -neighbourhood of \": However, it sometimes convenient not to have to worry about whether is an integer or positive, so we allow for in our definition (the two definitions are equivalent).  One can paraphrase \"convergence to \" as \"every -neighbourhood of contains all terms of the sequence from some point onwards\".  You may have seen strict inequality \" \" in the definition of convergence. Again, the two definitions are equivalent.    Give examples of sequences which converge and which don't converge.   Constant sequences are convergent Fix a real number , say . For each set . Then we claim that . To prove this, we must verify that holds. To this end, fix . We must find such that For this particular sequence, we have for all . Hence holds on taking .   The reciprocals of the naturals converge to 0  as  We must verify . Fixing , this constitutes showing that, from some point onwards, all terms lie in the -neighbourhood of zero . In other words, we want to find such that Setting we see that if then re-arranging the inequality gives , and so (as required).    A non-convergent sequence We claim that the sequence defined by for all does not converge to any real number . If were the limit of this sequence, then taking in gives the existence of such that for all we have . In particular, by the triangle inequality we have This is a contradiction.   Another non-convergent sequence We claim that the sequence does not converge to any real number . If were the limit of this sequence, then taking in gives the existence of such that for all we have . In particular, by the triangle inequality we have This is a contradiction.   Convergent sequences are bounded State and prove how convergent sequences are bounded.   Convergent sequences are bounded  Suppose that is a convergent sequence of reals. Then is a bounded sequence.  By definition of a bounded function ( ) we must show that Since the sequence is convergent, there exists such that . Taking in the definition of the limit ( ), there exists such that for all we have . Therefore, when , the triangle inequality gives Rounding up if necessary, we may assume that , so we can set Then for all we have .   Give an example of a sequence which is bounded but not convergent. The alternating sequence is bounded but not convergent (see ).

If is not an upper bound for then  There exists a set for which 0 is both an upper bound and lower bound.

Non-examinable proof  A useful trick in proving this theorem is to define a notion that we call being a \"viewpoint\":  We say that is a viewpoint Think of the as marking out the height of a mountain located at ; a viewpoint is precisely a summit whose view rightwards is not impeded by any other mountains. if .

Let be a bounded sequence of real numbers. By the definition of convergence ( ), we are required to demonstrate the existence of a real number and a subsequence such that as . By the Erdős-Szekeres theorem ( ) there exists a monotonic subsequence . Since this subsequence is bounded and monotonic, it tends to a real number by the monotone convergence principle ( ).

Cauchy sequence We say that a sequence of real numbers is Cauchy if   State how being a Cauchy sequence is equivalent to being convergent, and prove that convergence implies being Cauchy (the proof that Cauchy implies convergence is non-examinable).   Cauchy is equivalent to convergence  A sequence of real numbers is Cauchy ( ) if and only if it is convergent ( ).   Let us first prove the \"only if\" or \" \" direction. Fix .

Workshop questions  True\/false workshop quiz In your workshop, you will vote on whether you think each of the following statements is true (thumbs up) or false (thumbs down). For each question, your workshop tutor will ask one of you to briefly justify your vote. This justification can involve giving a counterexample (if false) or outlining which definition\/theorem the statement follows from (if true). The monotone convergence principle states that an increasing and bounded sequence is convergent. One consequence of the inequality rule is that a convergent sequence of positive reals has positive limit. The multiplication rule states that the product of two convergent sequences converges to the product of their limits. If , then such that for all we have . For any sequence with a limit, we have , provided we interpret and . We have if  If then is an increasing sequence. If and all are positive, then . If and all are positive, then .

Sequences have the same limit as their subsequences. There exist unbounded sequences none of whose subsequences have a limit.

Your participation in this activity will go towards your \"individual mark\" for the workshop (see ).   30-60 minutes: During the next 30 minutes of the workshop, you will break into groups in order to collaboratively write-up an answer to an exam-style self-test question. You will be given marker pens and a large sheet of A1 paper on which to do this. Your participation in this activity will go towards both your \"individual mark\" and \"group mark\" for the workshop (see ).

Your participation in this activity will go towards both your \"individual mark\" and \"group mark\" for the workshop (see ).    90-120 minutes: Your tutor will select one of the remaining two exam-style self-test questions and you will write-up a solution under exam conditions. The purpose of this is for you to receive feedback on how to improve your answers in real analysis.   The question should take you at most 20 minutes - the extra time is for those who require this in exams. However, everyone should feel free to use the extra time if needed.  You may not consult anyone else during the final 30 minutes.  You must include full details of your proofs and calculations.  The only results which you may use without further justification are those contained in the notes or other course materials, provided that you clearly paraphrase them.  Once you are finished, you should hand your attempt to your workshop tutor and leave quietly.  Please include your name on your submission.     Each workshop contributes towards your final mark. Your mark for each workshop is scored out of 3. You will receive 1 mark for each of the following:     Group mark . Your tutor will assign all members of your group 1 mark if your group:   writes up an answer to the self-test question assigned by your tutor for the group activity;  provides feedback and an indicative grade to another group.

Your tutor will assign you 1 mark if you submit a reasonable attempt at the exam-style self-test question which your tutor asks you to complete at the end of the workshop. If you are unable to answer this question, you will still receive 1 mark if your submission clearly explains the unsuccessful strategies you have attempted. You will not receive a mark if you do not attempt the question and do not explain the strategies attempted.   At your next workshop, your tutor will return your answer with formative feedback.   To help you get a sense of what your answer would achieve in an exam, your workshop tutor will also give you an indicative grade :    1st. Complete solution with no gaps or logical errors.   2nd. Almost complete solution, with a small number of gaps or logical errors   3rd. Answer demonstrates some of the relevant knowledge required for a solution.   4th.

  "body": " How to study this module  Each week you are expected to work through the corresponding self-test questions . These questions cover material covered in the week's lectures, almost all of which you should have seen in previous modules. The self-test questions are designed to allow you to actively learn the material by writing it up yourself.   Material is examinable if and only if it is covered in lectures.   I believe it is more beneficial to your learning to write out answers to self-test questions, rather than reading lecture notes. Here are some reasons why I believe this:  You have seen the majority of this material before, in MATH111-114. Sometimes our definitions will differ from those given in MATH111-114, see for instance our definition of \"upper Riemann integral\" This often happens in mathematics For instance, do the natural numbers contain 0? In this course, they do not , we take , the set of positive integers. However, in other courses\/books you may see 0 included as a natural number. ; no confusion should arise provided that one is consistent. In this course, the examinable definition is that given in the solutions to the self-test questions.  Mathematics is hard to read and to listen to. It is much more fun to write-up mathematics oneself, as this active process is closer to the puzzle-solving which draws many of us to the subject.  Evidence from educational psychology suggests that we understand and remember material more effectively if we first get it wrong . That is to say, we obtain better learning outcomes if we attempt a question, get it wrong, look up the solution, then write-up a correct answer.    Here is how I suggest that you work through the self-test questions:  Attempt the self-test questions in the order in which they are presented. Almost immediately, it is likely that you will find yourself unsure about what you are writing. That is okay! For example, if trying to define a uniformly continuous function , you may begin: We say that is uniformly continuous if ?? As you are writing this, some questions may occur to you: What should the domain of be? What about the co-domain? What comes after ? Is it or is it ?  As soon as you are stuck, you should look at the solution, reading until your query is answered.  Once your query is answered, cover up the solution and resume answering the self-test question. It is likely that you will shortly find yourself stuck once more. That is okay - simply repeat the above procedure!  Proceeding in this manner, one ends up reading the notes (which are in effect, the solutions to the questions) in detail, but when one does engage with the details, one is primed to understand and remember them.  You may choose to copy down what I write on the board in lectures, in order to compile your own booklet of \"examinable lecture notes\" .   Some thoughts on learning mathematics  Reading versus writing: When reading mathematics, do not try to understand every line. To try and follow all the details is hard and is not engaging. Mathematics is something you construct, like writing code, baking a cake or solving a puzzle; it is hard to passively follow someone else doing it.  It is better to get a sense of what is being discussed in the solutions, then challenge yourself to write-up the precise mathematics yourself. You will almost always have to immediately consult the solution again. However, when you read mathematics after trying to write it yourself, you are far more primed to engage with the details. It is like reading the solution to a problem you are stuck on - you really see what you were missing if you have tried the problem first. Often one reads until one spots the information previously missed or misunderstood, then has another attempt at writing-up.  This way of proceeding appears more time consuming than believing that your reading is complete once your eyes have passed over each word\/symbol. However in my experience, writing mathematics yourself is far more fun, and beneficial to your understanding, than trying to decode what someone else has written. View the solutions as a set of prompts, which one can use to check the validity of your own write-up.   Memorisation versus reconstruction: One can memorise every proof in this course for the purpose of the exam, however this is not a good idea for the following reasons:  We have limited memory, and it is therefore very hard to memorise such a large amount of information I do not know any of the proofs in this course from memory. .  Mathematicians are lazy - most of us do not like memorising large amounts of material. Successful mathematicians learn a few strategies which allow them to reconstruct proofs from first principles. On occasion one has to memorise a key \"trick\" or \"idea\", which it may be hard to think of yourself (particularly under exam conditions). However, memorising a handful of key \"tricks\" is much easier than memorising 100 pages of notes.  Our intended learning outcomes (see ) of \"writing proofs\" and \"constructing counterexamples\" are not met through memorisation. These learning outcomes are skills which can be acquired, and are useful in other situations, in mathematics and beyond.  In your assessment, you will be given statements to prove which are similar but not identical to those in the notes. Understanding how to construct a proof allows you to answer these questions, whereas memorising the proofs in the notes does not.     "

  "title": "<span class=\"process-math\">\\(\\ \\)<\/span>The purpose of this module",
  "body": " The purpose of this module  One of the purposes of real analysis is to prove that the laws of calculus are valid. Rather than using the \"plausible\" geometric reasoning you may have met in school mathematics, real analysis aims to reduce the laws of calculus to simple logical statements which can be verified by a human or even a computer. With this foundation in hand, one can go beyond calculus and give logical answers to questions such as the following:  What is the density of rational numbers between 0 and 1? The answer is 0, see MATH314 Lebesgue Integration.  What is the density of prime numbers in ? The answer is , see MATH328 Number Theory.  If one repeatedly samples a statistic, what shape does the resulting bar chart take? This question is answered by the \"law of large numbers\", see MATH313 Probability Theory.  Although these questions are not answered in this course, we lay the logical foundations which allow one to answer these questions in future courses.  If you would like to refresh you knowledge of logic and proof, I recommend reading the first 20 pages of the following lecture notes .   Learning outcomes  Having worked through this course, you should be able to:   Give rigorous logical definitions of concepts from calculus, such as \"limit\", \"continuous\", \"differentiable\". For instance:  Define the supremum of a set of real numbers.  Define what it means for a real number to be the limit of a sequence of real numbers.  Define what it means for a real-valued function on an open interval to be continuous.      Use logical proof to establish properties of the above concepts, for example:  Prove that every differentiable function on an open interval is continuous.  Prove that every continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.  Show that if is non-empty and bounded then       Construct counterexamples to illustrate why certain assumptions are necessary, for instance:  Construct a continuous function on an open interval which is not differentiable.  Construct a continuous function on an open interval which is not uniformly continuous.  Construct a set which is non-empty, but for which        We will consider few, if any, \"calculation\" questions. This is because our learning outcomes (see above) are concerned with becoming fluent in the rigour and logic required to articulate definitions and proofs in analysis, they are not about performing computations. Unfortunately, this is also one of the reasons why analysis can be hard to learn, at least initially. There are a number of reasons why it is important to become proficient in this rigour and logic:  The rigour and logic of analysis underlies much of mathematics; without it we may convince ourselves that , and this would have consequences for those subjects which rely on the accuracy of mathematics It is often argued that without mathematics, engineers would not be able to guarantee the safety of their bridges. .  Many of your future modules in mathematics build on the foundation laid down in real analysis: learning this foundation now makes your future courses much easier.  As a mathematician, you should want to know whether you have proved something or not: if one believes one has proved the Riemann hypothesis Perhaps the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics, with a \\$1,000,000 reward. then one would like to be able to check your argument before telling the world about it.  In order to understand your ideas, other mathematicians need to be able to read and verify your work.  In your future work, your employer may hire you on your ability as a mathematician to construct logical arguments.     "
