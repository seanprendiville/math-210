					<title>Algebra of continuity</title>
					<p>
					 Let <m>f, g : D \to \R</m> with <m>D \subset \R</m>.
 Let <m>x_0 \in D</m>.
 Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous at <m>x_0</m>.
 Then the sum <m>f+g</m> and product <m>f\cdot g</m> are both continuous at <m>x_0</m>.
 </p>
 <p>
If in addition <m>g(x_0) \neq 0</m>, then the quotient <m>f/g</m> is continuous at <m>x_0</m> (the quotient may not be defined on all of <m>D</m>, but it is defined on <m>D \cap (x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)</m> for some <m>\delta \gt 0</m>, see <xref ref="cor-non-zero-cts"/>).
</p>
<proof>
We prove the result for the sum, the remaining arguments being similar (and left to the reader). By definition of function limits (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>) and definition of continuity (<xref ref="def-cts"/>), we are required to show that if <m>(a_n)_n</m> is a sequence in <m>D</m> with <m>a_n\to x_0</m> then <m>f(a_n)+g(a_n)\to f(x_0)+g(x_0)</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>. Since both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous at <m>x_0</m>, we have <m>f(a_n)\to f(x_0)</m> and <m>g(a_n)\to g(x_0)</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>. Thus by the addition rule for sequential limits (<xref ref="prop-add-rule"/>) we have
<me>
\lim_{n\to \infty} \brac{f(a_n)+g(a_n)} = \lim_{n\to \infty} f(a_n)+\lim_{n\to \infty} g(a_n) = f(x_0) + g(x_0)

					<definition>
					<title>Polynomial</title>
 Let <m>D \subset \R</m>.
 We say that a function <m>f : D \to \R</m> is a <em>polynomial with real coefficients</em> if there exist <m>c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n \in \R</m> such that for all <m>x \in D</m> we have
<me>
f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \dots + c_n x^n.
</me>  
 We call <m>n</m> the <em>degree</em> of the polynomial.
 </definition>
 <proposition xml:id="prop-poly-cts">
 <statement>
Polynomials are continuous functions.
</statement>
<proof>
 The identity function <m>x \mapsto x</m> is continuous, since denoting this function by <m>f</m>, we have <m>a_n \to x_0</m> implies <m>f(a_n) \to f(x_0)</m>.
 By the multiplication rule (<xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>) it follows that <m>x^2</m> is continuous.
 Iterating this argument, we see that <m>x^3 = x\cdot x^2</m> is continuous.
 It follows from induction that <m>x^n</m> is continuous for any <m>n \in \N</m>.
 Since constant functions are continuous (<xref ref="eg-const-cts"/>), it again follows from the multiplication rule that <m>c_n x^n</m> is continuous for any <m>c_n \in \R</m>.
 By the addition rule (<xref ref="prop-add-rule"/>), the sum
<me>
c_0 + c_1x+ \dots + c_n x^n
</me>
is continuous.
 Hence polynomials are continuous.

 This follows from the fact that polynomials are continuous and the fact that continuity is preserved on taking quotients, provided that the denominator is non-zero (<xref ref="prop-alg-cts"/>). The fact that the denominator is not zero at any point in the domain of a rational function follows from <xref ref="def-rational"/> (the rational function would not be defined at a point at which the denominator is zero).

Let <m>(a_n)_n</m> be a sequence in <m>D_1</m> which tends to <m>x_0</m>. By definition of the function limit (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>), we are required to prove that <m>f_2 \circ f_1(a_n)\to f_2 \circ f_1(x_0)</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>.

 Then both <m>\min\set{f,g}</m> and <m>\max\set{f,g}</m> are continuous at <m>x_0 \in D</m>.
</statement>
<proof>
We first observe that
<me>
\max\set{f, 0} = \frac{ f+ |f|}{2}.
</me>
 The latter function is continuous at <m>x_0</m> on combining <xref ref="prop-alg-cts"/> and <xref ref="cor-abs-cts"/>.
 Next observe that
<me>
\max\set{f,g}= \max\set{f-g,0} + g.

 The latter function is continuous at <m>x_0</m> on combining our previous observation with the fact that the sum of two continuous functions is continuous (<xref ref="prop-alg-cts"/>). 
 The argument for <m>\min</m> is similar.

					<title>Uniform continuity implies continuity</title>
 It is important to compare the definition of uniform continuity <xref ref="eq-unif-cts"/> with that of continuity <xref ref="eq-eps-delta-cts"/>, the latter being: 
<mdn>
<mrow number="no">
(\forall x_0 \in D)(\forall \eps \gt 0)(\exists \delta = \delta(x_0,\eps) \gt 0)\amp (\forall x \in D)

\bigsqbrac{\ |x-x_0| \leq \delta \implies |f(x)-f(x_0)| \leq \eps\ }.
</mrow>
</mdn>
The only difference is the order of the quantifiers: for continuity <xref ref="eq-eps-delta-cts-2"/> the parameter <m>\delta= \delta(x_0, \eps)</m>  is allowed to depend on the point of continuity <m>x_0</m>, however for uniformity continuity <xref ref="eq-unif-cts"/> the same <m>\delta = \delta(\eps)</m> has to work for <em>all</em> points <m>x_0</m> in the domain <m>D</m>.
 If <m>f</m> is uniformly continuous then it is therefore continuous, on taking <m>\delta(x_0, \eps) := \delta(\eps)</m> for any <m>x_0 \in D</m>.
 However, the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic)" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic)">converse</url> is not always true, as the next example illustrates.
</remark>
<example>
<title>Continuity does not imply uniform continuity</title>
 Define <m>f : \R \to \R</m> at each <m>x \in \R</m> by <m>f(x) := x^2</m>.
 Then <m>f</m> is a polynomial, so is continuous on <m>\R</m> by <xref ref="prop-poly-cts"/>.
 By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>f</m> were uniformly continuous on <m>\R</m>. 
 Taking <m>\eps := 1</m> in the definition of uniform continuity (<xref ref="def-unif-cts"/>),  there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that if <m>|x_1 - x_2| \leq \delta</m> then <m>|x_1^2 - x_2^2| \leq 1</m>.
 Setting <m>x_2 := x_1 + \delta</m>, we deduce that for any <m>x_1 \gt 0</m> we have 
<me>
1 \geq |x_1^2 - x_2^2| = |x_1-x_2||x_1+x_2| = \delta (2x_1+\delta) \geq \delta x_1.
</me>
 Taking, say, <m>x_1 = 2/\delta</m> then yields a contradiction.
 The domain of a function is important for uniform continuity: the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is not uniformly continuous on <m>\R</m>, yet one can show that it is uniformly continuous on any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> (see <xref ref="thm-unif-cts"/>).

 Suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.

<proof>
 By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>f</m> is not uniformly continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.

 By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (<xref ref="cor-bolzano"/>) and the inequality rule for limits (<xref ref="prop-ineq-rule"/>) there exists <m>x_0\in [a,b]</m> and  <m>k(1) \lt  k(2) \lt  \dots</m> such that <m>x_{k(n)} \to x_0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
  Applying the same argument to the sequence <m>(y_{k(n)})_n</m>, there exists <m>y_0\in [a,b]</m> and  <m>\ell_1 \lt  \ell_2 \lt  \dots</m> such that <m>y_{k(\ell_n)} \to y_0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 Since subsequences of convergent sequence tend to the same limit (<xref ref="prop-subseq-conv"/>), we also have <m>x_{k(\ell_n)} \to x_0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 Notice that

 Therefore <m>x_0 = y_0</m>.
 Yet continuity of <m>f</m>, continuity of the absolute value and the addition rule (<xref ref="prop-add-rule"/>) together give that

 Since this is a contradiction, it follows that <m>f</m> must indeed be uniformly continuous.

<title>Intermediate value theorem</title>
<statement>
 Let <m>f : [a,b] \to \R</m> be a continuous function on a closed interval <m>[a,b] \subset \R</m>.
 For any real number <m>y</m> between<fn>i.e. if <m>f(a) \leq f(b)</m> then <m>f(a) \leq y \leq f(b)</m>, whilst if <m>f(a) \gt f(b)</m> then <m>f(a) \geq y \geq f(b)</m>.</fn> <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>, there exists <m>x \in [a,b]</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
We prove the result assuming that <m>f(a) \leq y \leq f(b)</m>; if <m>f(a) \geq y \geq f(b)</m> then we reduce to the former case on considering <m> -f</m>.
 Set
<me>
x := \sup\set{t \in [a,b] : f(t) \leq y}.
</me>
 The above supremum exists because the set is non-empty (it contains <m>a</m>) and is bounded above by <m>b</m>. In particular, <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>.
 We claim that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
 </p>
 <p>
 We first observe that for any <m>n\in \N</m> the number <m>x-1/n</m> is smaller than the supremum, so cannot be an upper bound. Hence there exists <m>t_n \in [a,b]</m> with <m>f(t_n) \leq y</m> and <m>x-1/n \lt t_n \leq x</m>. By the sandwich rule we have <m>t_n \to x</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>, so by continuity and the inequality rule, we get that <m>f(x)= \lim_{n\to \infty} f(t_n) \leq y</m>. 
 </p>
 <p>
 It remains to show that <m>f(x_0) \geq y</m>. By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>f(x_0) \lt y</m>.
  Then <m>x_0 \lt b</m> (since <m>f(b) \geq y </m>).
 Continuous functions which are positive at a point are positive on a neighbourhood of that point (see <xref ref="cor-non-zero-cts"/>). 
 Hence there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that for all <m>x\in [a,b]\cap(x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)</m> we have <m> y-f(x) \gt 0</m>.
On setting  
<me>
\eps := \min\set{b-x_0, \delta/2} \gt 0,
</me>
we obtain <m>x+\eps \in [a,b]</m> with <m>f(x+\eps) \leq y</m>. Yet, since <m>x+\eps</m> exceeds <m>x</m>, this contradicts the definition of <m>x</m> as the least upper bound of the set of <m>t \in [a,b]</m> with <m>f(t) \leq y</m>.

 One can check that

0^n \leq a \leq (1+a)^n.

</me>
 In particular, a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded.
 </statement>

<proof>
 We prove the result for the supremum, the argument for the infimum being similar.
 Notice that the supremum <m>
 \sup_{[a,b]} f
</m>
is either real or equal to <m>\infty</m>. We first discount the latter situation.
 If <m>\sup_{[a,b]} f = \infty</m> then for any <m>n \in \N</m> there exist <m>x_n \in [a,b]</m> with <m>f(x_n) \gt n</m> (otherwise <m>n</m> is a finite upper bound for <m>f</m>).
 By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  \dots</m> such that the subsequence <m>x_{k_n}</m> tends to a real limit <m>x_0</m> for some <m>x_0 \in \R</m>.
 By the inequality rule (<xref ref="prop-ineq-rule"/>) we have <m>x_0 \in [a,b]</m>.
 By continuity (<xref ref="def-cts"/>) and the inequality rule (<xref ref="prop-ineq-rule"/>) we have
<me>
f(x_0) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_{k_n}) \geq \lim_{n \to \infty} k_n = \infty.
</me>
 This is a contradiction, since <m>f(x_0)</m> is a real number.
 It follows that the supremum is finite.
 Since decreasing a supremum gives a non upper bound (<xref ref="prop-alt-sup"/>), for each <m>n \in \N</m> there exists <m>x_n \in [a,b]</m> such that 
<me xml:id="eq-sup-sand">
\brac{\sup_{[a,b]} f}-\recip n \lt  f(x_n) \leq \sup_{[a,b]} f.

 Since the set <m>[a,b]</m> is bounded, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (<xref ref="cor-bolzano"/>) gives the existence of <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  k_3 \lt  \dots</m> such that the subsequence <m>x_{k_n}</m> converges to some <m>x_0 \in [a,b]</m>.
 Since <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x_0</m>, the sequential definition of continuity (<xref ref="def-cts"/>) gives that

 Then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m> with derivative <m>y</m> if and only if for any sequence <m>(a_n)_n</m> in <m>(a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m> with <m>a_n\to x_0</m> we have
 <men xml:id="eq-seq-diff">
 \frac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}{a_n-x_0} \to y \text{ as } n \to \infty
 </men>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
This is essentially the same argument as that given in the proof of <xref ref="cor-eps-delta-cts"/>.
</p>
<p>
 We first prove the "<m>\implies</m>" direction.
 Let <m>(a_n)_n</m> be a sequence in <m>(a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m> such that <m>a_n \to x_0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 We are required to prove <xref ref="eq-seq-diff"/>, assuming <xref ref="eq-eps-diff"/>.
 Fix <m>\eps \gt0</m>.
 Then by <xref ref="eq-eps-diff"/> there exists <m>\delta = \delta(\eps) \gt 0</m> such that if <m>x \in (a,b)</m> and <m>0\lt |x-x_0| \leq \delta</m> then 
 <me>
 \abs{\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0} - y}\leq \eps
 </me>.
 Since <m>a_n \to x_0</m> there exists <m>N = N(\delta)</m> such that for all <m> n\geq N</m> we have <m>0\lt |a_n - x_0| \leq \delta</m>.
 Hence if <m>n \geq N(\delta)</m> then 
  <me>
 \abs{\frac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}{a_n-x_0} - y}\leq \eps
 </me>.
 This establishes <xref ref="eq-seq-diff"/>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Next we prove the "<m>\impliedby</m>" direction. To do so we prove the contrapositive.
 Hence, suppose that the negation of <xref ref="eq-eps-diff"/> holds:
<md>
<mrow>
(\exists \eps \gt 0)(\forall \delta  \gt 0)\amp(\exists x= x(\delta) \in (a,b))
</mrow>
<mrow>
\bigsqbrac{\ 0\lt |x-x_0| \leq \delta\quad \text{and}\quad \abs{\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0} - y} \gt \eps\ }
</mrow>
</md>.

 Taking <m>\delta = 1/n</m> in the above negation, set <m>a_1:= x(1)</m>, <m>a_2:=x(1/2)</m>, <m>a_3 := x(1/3)</m>, etc.
 Then <m>a_n \in (a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m>, <m>|a_n - x_0| \leq 1/n</m> and 
 <me>
 \abs{\frac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}{a_n-x_0} - y} \geq \eps
 </me>.
 Hence <m>(a_n)_n</m> is a sequence in <m>(a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m> with <m>a_n \to x_0</m> and 
 <me>
 \frac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}{a_n-x_0} \not\to y
 </me>, (as required).

By the epsilon-delta definition of continuity (see <xref ref="cor-eps-delta-cts"/>) we are required to verify that

 Let us assume that <m>f'(x_0) \neq 0</m>, the remaining case being simpler.

 In other words, there exists <m>c \in \R</m> such that for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m> we have <m>f(x) = c</m>.

Since differentiable functions are continuous, any example of a non-continuous function is also an example of a non-differentiable function. For instance, the function <xref ref="eg-dis-cont"/> is discontinuous at <m>x=0</m>, so is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>. Similarly, <xref ref="eg-dis-cont-everywhere"/> is discontinuous everywhere, so is also nowhere differentiable.
