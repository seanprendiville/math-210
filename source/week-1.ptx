				<title>Upper and lower bounds</title>

						<title>Upper/lower bound</title>
						<p>
						We say that <m>M \in \R</m> is an <em>upper bound</em> for the set <m>S\subset \R</m> if
							<men xml:id="eq-def-upper-bound">
								(\forall x \in S)[x \leq M].

						<m>M</m> is a <em>lower bound</em> for <m>S</m> if
							<me>
								(\forall x \in S)[x \geq M].

						<m>M</m> is an upper/lower bound for the function <m>f:D\to \R</m> if it is an upper/lower bound for the image set
							<me>
								f(D) := \set{f(x) : x \in D}.

						<example>
							<ul>
							<li>
							If <m>S =\set{1,2}</m> then 3 is an upper bound for <m>S</m>.
							<proof>
							We must check that for every <m>x\in S</m> we have <m> x \leq 3</m>. The only elements of <m>S</m> are 1 and 2, and both of the inequalities <m>1\leq 3</m> and <m>2\leq 3</m> hold. We have therefore verified that the defining condition <xref ref="eq-def-upper-bound"/> of being an upper bound holds.
							</proof>
							</li>
							<li>
							If <m>S= \set{0,1}</m> then 1 is an upper bound for <m>S</m>.
							<proof>
							We have <m>0\leq1</m> and <m>1\leq 1</m>. So for all <m>x \in S</m> we have <m> x \leq 1</m>.
							</proof>
							</li>
							<li>
							If <m>S= (0, \infty)</m> then 0 is a lower bound for <m>S</m>.
							<proof>
							If <m>x \in S</m> then by definition <m> x \geq 0</m>.
							</proof>
							</li>
							<li>
							If <m>S= (-\infty,0)</m> then <m>-1</m> is not an upper bound for <m>S</m>.
							<proof>
							Negating the definition <xref ref="eq-def-upper-bound"/> of being an upper bound, we must show that for <m>M = -1</m> we have
							<men xml:id="eq-negate-upper-bound">
							(\exists x \in S)[x \gt M].
							</men>
							This holds since, for instance, <m>x:= -1/2 \in S </m> satisfies <m> x > -1</m>.
							</proof>
							</li>
						</ul>
					<!--
						<p>
							Consider the function <m>f:\set{1,2}\to\R</m> given by <m>f(1):=1</m> and <m>f(2):=2</m>. Then 3 is an upper bound for both the set <m>\set{1,2}</m> and the function <m>f</m> (notice that <m>\set{1,2} = f(\set{1,2})</m>. To prove this, we must check that <m>3\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in \set{1,2}</m>, which is indeed true since <m>3\geq1</m> and <m>3\geq2</m>.  
						</p>
						<p>
							A similar argument shows that the number 1 is a lower bound for both the set <m>\set{1,2}</m> and the function <m>f</m>. Yet 1 is not an upper bound for either, since it is not the case that <m>1\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in \set{1,2}</m> (because it is not the case that <m>1\geq2</m>).
						</p>
						<p>
							The function <m>g : \R \to \R</m> given by <m>g(x) := 1</m> for all <m>x \in \R</m> has 1 as both an upper bound and a lower bound.

						<definition>
						<title>Bounded above/below</title>
						<p>
							We say that a set <m>S\subset\R</m> is <em>bounded above</em> if it has an upper bound, that is
							<men xml:id="eq-upper-bound">
								(\exists M \in \R)(\forall x \in S)[x \leq M].

							A set/function is <em>bounded below</em> if it has a lower bound.

					<statement><p>
						Define what it means to be a <em>supremum</em> or <em>infimum</em> for a set of real numbers.
					</p></statement>
					<solution>
						<definition xml:id="def-sup">
							<title>Supremum</title>
							<p>
							<m>M \in \R</m> is a <em>supremum</em> for <m>S \subset \R</m> if <m>M</m> is an upper bound for <m>S</m> and any any other upper bound <m>\tilde M</m> for <m>S</m> is larger, so that <m>\tilde M \geq  M</m>.
							</p>
						</definition>
						<p>
							In other words, <m>M</m> is the <em>least upper bound</em> for <m>S</m>, and we denote this quantity <m>\sup S</m> (if it exists).

						<definition xml:id="def-inf">
						<title>Infimum</title>
							<p>
							<m>M \in \R</m> is an <em>infimum</em> for <m>S \subset \R</m> if <m>M</m> is a lower bound for <m>S</m> and any any other lower bound <m>\tilde M</m> for <m>S</m> is smaller, so that <m>\tilde M \leq  M</m>.

							In other words, <m>M</m> is the <em>greatest lower bound</em> for <m>S</m>, and we denote this quantity <m>\inf S</m> (if it exists).
						</p>
						<example>
						<ul>
						<li> <m>\sup\set{1,2,3} = 3.</m>
						<proof>
						3 is an upper bound for <m>\set{1,2,3}</m>. We must show it is the least upper bound. Suppose that <m>M</m> is another upper bound for <m>\set{1,2,3}</m>. Then by definition of being an upper bound and the fact that 3 lies in our set, we have that <m>3 \leq M</m>. Thus 3 is smaller than any other upper bound, thereby satisfies the definition (<xref ref="def-sup"/>) of being a supremum.
						</proof>
						</li>
						<li> <m> \sup (-\infty, 1) = 1.</m>
						<proof>
						By definition <m> (-\infty, 1) = \set{x\in \R : x \lt 1}</m>, so 1 is certainly an upper bound for the set. It remains to show that 1 is the smallest upper bound. To this end, suppose that <m>M</m> is another upper bound for <m> (-\infty, 1)</m>. Notice that if <m> M \lt 1</m>, then any element strictly between <m>M</m> and 1 (for instance the midpoint <m>(M+1)/2</m> will be an element of <m>(-\infty, 1)</m> which exceeds the upper bound <m>M</m> (a contradiction). Therefore we must have <m> M\geq 1</m>, so that 1 is the least upper bound (as claimed).
						</proof>
						<p>
						Notice that this example shows that <em>the supremum does not always lie in the set</em>. When the supremum lies in the set we call it the <em>maximum</em> (see <xref ref="def-max"/>).
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<m>\sup \emptyset</m> does not exist.
						<proof>
						Every <m>M\in \R</m> is an upper bound for <m>S = \emptyset</m>, since the negation <xref ref="eq-negate-upper-bound"/> does not hold (we say that a statement of the form <m>(\forall x \in \emptyset)[\dots]</m> is true "vacuously", since the negation cannot hold due to there being no elements in the empty set). No real <m>M</m> can be the least upper bound for the empty set, since <m>M-1</m> is a smaller upper bound.
						</proof>
						This means that we can only take the supremum of a <em>non-empty set</em>.
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>
						If <m>S\subset \R</m> is <em>not bounded above</em> (for instance <m>S=\R</m>) then <m>S</m> has no upper bound, in particular no <em>least</em> upper bound. Thus <m>\sup S</m> does not exist. 
						</p>
						<p>
						This means that we can only take the supremum of a set which is <em>bounded above</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
						The <em>completeness principle</em> (<xref ref="completeness-principle"/>) says that if <m>S</m> is non-empty and bounded above, then <m>\sup S</m> exists.
						</p>
						</li>
						<!--
						<li> <m>\sup [0,1) = 1.</m></li>
						<li>
						<p>
							For a non-example, we observe that 2 is not a supremum for the set
								<me>
									\set{\recip{n}: n \in \N}.
								</me>
							Although 2  <em>is</em> an upper bound for this set, it is not a supremum because there exists a <em>smaller</em> upper bound (e.g. 1).
						</p>
						<p>
							For an example of a set without a supremum, consider
								<me>
									\N := \set{1,2,3,\dots}.
								</me>
							This set does not have a smallest upper bound because it does not have any upper bounds (if <m>M\in \R</m> were a purported upper bound for <m>\N</m> then we would have a contradiction, since the natural number 
							<me>
								\max\set{1,\ceil{M}+1}

				<proof>
				Let <m>\eps\gt0</m> be arbitrary; we are required to find <m>x\in S</m> such that <m>x\gt \sup S-\eps</m>. Aiming for a contradiction, let us suppose that this does not hold, so that for all <m>x\in S</m> we have <m>x\leq \sup S-\eps</m>. But then <m>\sup S-\eps</m> is an upper bound for <m>S</m> which is strictly smaller than <m>\sup S</m>. Since <m>\sup S</m> is the smallest upper bound for <m>S</m>, we have obtained our desired contradiction.

						<title>The completeness principle</title>
						<p>
						Suppose that a set of real numbers <m>S\subset \R</m> is
							<ul>
								<li>
									non-empty
								</li>
								<li>
									bounded above,
								</li>
							</ul>
						then <m>S</m> has a supremum, <m>\sup S\in \R</m>.
						</p>
						<p>
						In other words, any set with an upper bound has a <em>least</em> upper bound (provided that the set is non-empty).
						</p>
						<proof>
						<em>NON-EXAMINABLE</em>. The proof depends on how one constructs the real numbers, of which there are many alternative constructions (e.g. Dedekind cuts of rationals, decimal expansions, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences, etc). See <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers</url>.
						</proof>
						</theorem>
						<remark>
						In this course, the completeness principle is the main result we use (repeatedly, sometimes in a hidden manner) in order to show that certain limits exist. For instance all of the following involve a limit in their construction, and the existence of this limit is guaranteed (under certain conditions) by the completeness principle:
						<me>
						\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n, \qquad \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x),\qquad f'(x_0), \qquad \int_a^b f.
						</me>
						</remark>
						<remark>
						The completeness principle is equivalent to the following statement involving the <em>infimum</em>:
						<corollary>
						<p>
						Suppose that a set of real numbers <m>S\subset \R</m> is
							<ul>
								<li>
									non-empty
								</li>
								<li>
									bounded below,
								</li>
							</ul>
						then <m>S</m> has an infimum, <m>\inf S\in \R</m>.
						</p>
						<p>
						In other words, any set with a lower bound has a <em>greatest</em> lower bound (provided that the set is non-empty).
						</p>
						</corollary>
						The second statement can be derived from the first by reflecting the set through zero to obtain <m>-S:=\set{-x: x\in S}</m>, then observing that <m>\sup(-S) = -\inf S</m>.
						</remark>
						<example>
						<p>
						As an example of how the completeness principle can be used, we outline how to construct a square-root of two from the rational numbers. 
						</p>
						<p>
						First observe that the set
						<me>
						\set{a/b \in \Q : (a/b)^2 \leq 2}
						</me>
						is bounded above (e.g. by 100) and non-empty (e.g. it contains 1). Hence by the completeness principle, it has a supremum 
						<me>
						x :=\sup\set{a/b \in \Q : (a/b)^2 \leq 2}.
						</me>
						We leave it as an exercise for the enthusiastic reader to demonstrate that <m>x^2 = 2</m>, so that <m>x</m> is a square-root of two.

					Some examples of sequences include:

								(4,2,8,6,12,10, \dots)

							Notice that this is a different sequence to our first example, since they have different 1st term. The order of a sequence matters.
							</li>
							<li> A constant sequence, consisting of the same real number repeated at every term, e.g.

							The set of even numbers
								<me>
								\set{2, 4, 6, \dots} = \set{4,2,8,6,12,10,\dots}

							<li> 
							The set

							For a sequence, different <em>terms</em> may take the same <em>value</em>. It makes sense to say that the value <m>\pi</m> occurs infinitely often in a sequence. However, there are no repetitions of elements in a set: an element either belongs once or not at all.

							<men xml:id="eq-const-to-prove">
							n \geq N(\eps)\implies |a_n-a| \leq \eps.
							</men>
							For this particular sequence, we have <m>|a_n-a| = |a-a| = 0</m> for all <m>n</m>. Hence <xref ref="eq-const-to-prove"/> holds on taking <m>N(\eps) :=1</m>.

							<title>The reciprocals of the naturals converge to 0</title>
						<m>1/n \to 0</m> as <m>n\to \infty</m>
						<proof> 
						We must verify <xref ref="eq-seq-limit"/>. Fixing <m>\eps \gt 0</m>, this constitutes showing that, from some point onwards, all terms lie in the <m>\eps</m>-neighbourhood of zero <m>[-\eps,\eps]</m>. In other words, we want to find <m>N = N(\eps)</m> such that 
							<me>
							n \geq N(\eps)\implies 1/n \in [-\eps, \eps].
							</me>
							Setting <m>N(\eps):= 1/\eps</m> we see that if <m>n\geq N(\eps) = 1/\eps</m> then re-arranging the inequality gives <m>1/n \leq \eps</m>, and so <m>|\recip{n}-0|\leq \eps</m> (as required).

						<title>A non-convergent sequence</title>
						We claim that the sequence <m>(a_n)_n</m> defined by <m>a_n:=n</m> for all <m>n</m> does not converge to any real number <m>a \in \R</m>. If <m>a\in \R</m> were the limit of this sequence, then taking <m>\eps:=1/3</m> in <xref ref="eq-seq-limit"/> gives the existence of <m>N</m> such that for all <m>n\geq N</m> we have <m>|a-n| \leq 1/3</m>. In particular, by the triangle inequality we have
						<me>
						1 = |(N+1)-N| \leq |(N+1)-a|+|a-N| \leq 2/3.

						This is a contradiction.

If <m>a\in \R</m> were the limit of this sequence, then taking <m>\eps:=1/2</m> in <xref ref="eq-seq-limit"/> gives the existence of <m>N</m> such that for all <m>n\geq N</m> we have <m>|a-(-1)^n| \leq 1/2</m>. In particular, by the triangle inequality we have

						2 = |(-1)^{N+1}-(-1)^N| \leq |(-1)^{N+1}-a|+|a-(-1)^N| \leq 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

							<title>Convergent sequences are bounded</title>
							<statement><p>
						Suppose that <m>(a_n)</m> is a convergent sequence of reals. Then <m>(a_n)</m> is a bounded sequence.
							</p></statement>
						<proof>
						By definition of a bounded function (<xref ref="def-upper-bound"/>) we must show that
<me>
(\exists M \in \R)(\forall n \in \N)[|a_n| \leq M].
</me>
Since the sequence is convergent, there exists <m>a \in \R</m> such that <m>a_n \to a</m>.
Taking <m>\eps :=1</m> in the definition of the limit (<xref ref="def-seq-limit"/>), there exists <m>N = N(1)</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N</m> we have <m>|a_n - a| \leq 1</m>. Therefore, when <m>n \geq N</m>, the triangle inequality gives
<me>
|a_n| = |a_n - a + a| \leq |a_n-a| + |a| \leq 1 + |a|.
</me>
Rounding up if necessary, we may assume that <m>N \in \N</m>, so we can set
<me>
M:= \max\set{|a_1|, \dots, |a_{N}|, 1+|a|}.

 Then for all <m>n \in \N</m> we have <m>|a_n| \leq M</m>.

True/false workshop quiz
</title>
<p>
In your workshop, you will vote on whether you think each of the following statements is true (thumbs up) or false (thumbs down). For each question, your workshop tutor will ask one of you to briefly justify your vote. This justification can involve giving a counterexample (if false) or outlining which definition/theorem the statement  follows from (if true).
