							<title>A sequence tending to <m>\infty</m></title>
						Set <m>a_n: = n</m> for each <m>n \in \N</m>. Then we claim that <m>a_n \to \infty</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>. To prove this, we must verify that <xref ref="eq-seq-div-inf"/> holds. To this end, fix <m>M \gt 0</m>. We must find <m>N = N(M) \in \N</m> such that

							We claim that it is not the case that <m>a_n\to\infty</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>. To establish this we must show that <xref ref="eq-seq-div-inf"/> does not hold, i.e. that

			If <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence of real numbers with <m>a_n\to \infty</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>, then for any <m> c>0</m> we have <m> ca_n\to \infty</m> as <m>n\to \infty</m>.

			<solution>
			<proposition>
			<statement>
			Let <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> and <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be sequences of reals. Suppose that <m>a_n\to \infty</m> as <m>n\to \infty</m>. Suppose also that <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is eventually bounded away from zero<fn>For example, if <m>b_n \to b</m> for some <m> b \gt 0</m>.</fn>, in that

			<proof>
			Since <m>a_n \to \infty</m>, the sequence is eventually positive, in that there is some <m>N_1</m> such that if <m>n\geq N_1</m> then <m>a_n\gt 0</m>. If <m>N</m> denotes the quantity appearing in <xref ref="eq-unif-below"/>, then for all <m> n\geq \max\set{N_1, N}</m> we have

			<proposition>
			<statement>
			Let <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> and <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be sequences of reals. Suppose that <m>a_n\to \infty</m> as <m>n\to \infty</m>. Suppose also that <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is  bounded below. Then <m>a_n+b_n \to \infty</m> as <m>n\to \infty</m>.
			</statement>
			<proof>
			<p>
			Given <m>M \gt 0</m>, we would like to find <m>N=N(M)</m> such that if <m>n \geq N(M)</m> then <m>a_n+b_n \geq M</m>.

			We know both of the following hold:

			</me>,
			<me>
			(\exists M_1 \in \R)(\forall n \in \N)[b_n \geq M_1].
			</me>
			Thus for all <m>n\in \N</m> we have <m> a_n + b_n \geq a_n + M_1</m>, so that if <m>n \geq N_1(M-M_1)</m> we have 
			<m>
			a_n+b_n \geq (M-M_1) + M_1 = M.

			Thus the result follows on taking <m>N(M):=N_1(M-M_1)</m>.

							<proof>
 							For <m>n \gt d</m>, we may use the binomial theorem to deduce that

 							With inequality <xref ref="eq-weak-bernoulli-2"/> in hand, there are many ways to proceed (try it yourself!). What follows is one possible argument. By <xref ref="eq-weak-bernoulli-2"/> we have

							For <m>n \geq 2d</m> we have <m>1-\frac{d}{n} \geq 1/2</m>, therefore

							<title>Subsequence</title>
							<statement>
								<p>
								Let <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> and <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be real sequences.
 We say that <m>(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a subsequence of <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> if there exists a strictly increasing (see <xref ref="def-monotone"/>) function <m>k : \N \to \N</m> such that

								</p>
								<p>
 We often write <em>"let <m>(a_{k(n)})_{n =1}^\infty</m> be a subsequence of <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m>"</em> to mean that <m>k : \N \to \N</m> is a strictly increasing function.

 <p>
 To save on brackets (at the cost of multiple subscripts) we may also write  <em>"let <m>(a_{k_n})_{n =1}^\infty</m> be a subsequence of <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m>"</em> to mean that the function <m>\N \to \N</m> given by <m>n \mapsto k_n</m> is strictly increasing, so that

<proof>
 We proceed by induction on <m>n</m>.
 The base case <m>k_1 \geq 1</m> is true because <m>k_1 \in \N</m>.
 As induction hypothesis, suppose that <m>k_{n-1} \geq n-1</m>.
 Since <m>k_n \gt k_{n-1}</m> we have that <m>k_n \geq k_{n-1} +1 \geq (n-1) + 1 = n</m>.
 This proves the induction step, completing the proof.

 Then <m>a_{k_n} \to a</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 In particular, any subsequence  <m>(a_{k_n})_{n =1}^\infty</m> of  <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> tends to the same limit.

							<proof>
 We prove the result for <m>a \in \R</m> and leave the cases in which <m>a = \pm \infty</m> to the reader.

<title>Sequences may not have the same limit as their subsequences</title>

					By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>x^n \to a</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 Since passing to a subsequence does not change the limit, we have

							<statement>
							Every sequence of real numbers has a monotonic subsequence.

							<proof>
							<title>Non-examinable proof</title>
							<p>
							A useful trick in proving this theorem is to define a notion that we call being a "viewpoint":
							</p>
							<p>
 We say that <m>k \in \N</m> is a <em>viewpoint</em><fn>Think of the <m>a_n</m> as marking out the height of a mountain located at <m>n</m>; a viewpoint is precisely a summit whose view rightwards is not impeded by any other mountains.</fn> if <m>(\forall n \geq k)[a_k\geq a_n]</m>.
 If there are infinitely many viewpoints <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  k_3 \lt  \dots</m> then the subsequence <m>(a_{k_n})_{n=1}^\infty</m> is decreasing.
 We may therefore suppose that there are only finitely many viewpoints.
 In particular, there exists <m>k_0\geq 0</m> such that no <m>n \gt k_0</m> is a viewpoint, so that there exists a higher point <m>a_m</m> to the right of <m>a_n</m>. More precisely:
<me>
(\forall n \gt k_0)(\exists m(n) \gt n)[ a_{m(n)} \gt a_n  ].
</me>
 Let us recursively define <m>k_n</m> as follows: <m>k_1 := k_0+1</m> and if <m>k_n</m> has been defined then we set <m>k_{n+1} := m(k_n)</m>.
 Then <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  \dots</m> is strictly increasing and for each <m>n\in \N</m> we have
<me>
a_{k_{n+1}} = a_{m(k_n)} \gt a_{k_n}.

Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.

</corollary>
						<proof>
 Let <m>(a_n)_{n =1}^\infty</m> be a bounded sequence of real numbers.
 By the definition of convergence (<xref ref="def-seq-limit"/>), we are required to demonstrate the existence of a real number <m>a</m> and a subsequence <m>(a_{k_n})_{n = 1}^\infty</m> such that <m>a_{k_n} \to a</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
 By the Erdős-Szekeres theorem (<xref ref="thm-erd-sz"/>) there exists a monotonic subsequence <m>(a_{k_n})_{n = 1}^\infty</m>.
 Since this subsequence is bounded and monotonic, it tends to a real number <m>a \in \R</m> by the monotone convergence principle (<xref ref="prop-mono-lim"/>).

						<title>Cauchy is equivalent to convergence</title>
						<statement>
A sequence of real numbers <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is Cauchy (<xref ref="def-cauchy"/>) if and only if it is convergent (<xref ref="def-seq-limit"/>).
						</statement>
						<proof>
						<p>
 Let us first prove the "only if" or "<m>\impliedby</m>" direction. 
 Fix <m>\eps \gt 0</m>.
 By definition of convergence (<xref ref="def-seq-limit"/>) there exists <m>N = N(\eps/2) \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N</m> we have <m>|a_n - a| \leq \eps/2</m>.
 Thus by the triangle inequality, if <m>n, m\geq N</m> then 
<me>
|a_n -a_m| \leq |a_n-a| + |a-a_m| \leq \eps/2 + \eps/2 = \eps.
</me>
 Hence the sequence is Cauchy.
 </p>
 <p>
 <em>Non-examinable:</em> Next, let us first prove the "if" or "<m>\implies</m>" direction. Suppose that <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is Cauchy.
 We first claim that the sequence is bounded.
 Taking <m>\eps := 1</m> in the definition of being Cauchy (<xref ref="def-cauchy"/>) there exists <m>N</m> such that for all <m>n\geq N</m> we have <m>|a_n-a_N| \leq 1</m>.
 Hence by the triangle inequality, for all <m>n\geq N</m> we have 
<me>
|a_n|  = | (a_n-a_N) + a_N| \leq 1 + |a_N|.
</me>
 Setting 
<me>
M:=  \max\set{|a_1|, \dots, |a_{N-1}|, |a_N| + 1}
</me>
we deduce that <m>|a_n| \leq M</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>, so the sequence is bounded.
 By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (<xref ref="cor-bolzano"/>) there exists a subsequence <m>(a_{k_n})_{n=1}^\infty</m> which converges to  a real number <m>a</m>. 
 Let us show that <m>a_n \to a</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>, or in other words
<men xml:id="eq-cau-implies-conv-1">
(\forall \eps \gt 0)(\exists N \in \N)(\forall n \geq N)[|a_n-a| \leq \eps].
</men>
 Fix <m>\eps \gt 0</m>. 
 Since <m>a_{k_n} \to a</m> there exists <m>N_1 = N_1(\eps/2) \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N_1</m> we have <m>|a_{k_n} - a| \leq \eps/2</m>.
 Since <m>(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is Cauchy (<xref ref="def-cauchy"/>) there exists <m>N_2 =  N_2(\eps/2) \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n, m\geq N_2</m> we have <m>|a_n-a_m| \leq \eps/2</m>.
 Since the <m>(k_n)_n</m> are a strictly increasing sequence of integers,  if <m>n\geq N_2</m> then <m>k_n \geq n \geq N_2</m> also (see <xref ref="lem-inc-bound"/>).
 Setting <m>N(\eps) := \max\set{N_1, N_2}</m>, if <m>n \geq N</m> then the triangle inequality gives that
<me>
 |a_n -a| \leq |a_n - a_{k_n}| + |a_{k_n}-a| \leq \eps.
</me>
 This establishes that <m>a_n \to a</m>.

<p>
In your workshop, you will vote on whether you think each of the following statements is true (thumbs up) or false (thumbs down). For each question, your workshop tutor will ask one of you to briefly justify your vote. This justification can involve giving a counterexample (if false) or outlining which definition/theorem the statement  follows from (if true).
