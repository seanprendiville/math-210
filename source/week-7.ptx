<statement>
 Let <m>f,g: (a,b)\to \R</m> be differentiable at <m>x_0 \in (a,b)</m>.
 Then the sum <m>f+g</m> and product <m>f\cdot g</m> are differentiable at <m>x_0</m>.
 Moreover, their derivatives satisfy the identities

</statement>
<proof>
 We verify both identities using the sequential characterisation of differentiability (<xref ref="prop-seq-diff"/>) together with the addition and product rules for sequence limits (<xref ref="prop-add-rule"/> and <xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>). To this end, let <m>(a_n)_n</m> be a sequence in <m>(a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m> with <m>a_n \to x_0</m>. Then the addition rule follows from the addition rule for sequence limits, since 
 <md>
 <mrow>
\lim_{n \to \infty} \amp \frac{(f+g)(a_n)-(f+g)(x_0)}{a_n-x_0}
</mrow>
<mrow>
\amp = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}{a_n-x_0}+ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{g(a_n)-g(x_0)}{x-x_0}.
</mrow>
</md>
 The product rule uses the identity
 <md>
 <mrow>
 \amp f(a_n)g(a_n) - f(x_0)g(x_0)  = \sqbrac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}g(a_n) + f(x_0)\sqbrac{g(a_n)-g(x_0)}
 </mrow>

\amp =\sqbrac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}\sqbrac{g(a_n)-g(x_0)} + \sqbrac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}g(x_0)+ f(x_0)\sqbrac{g(a_n)-g(x_0)}. 
</mrow>
</md>
 By the multiplication rule for sequence limits (<xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>), we have
<md alignment="gather">
<mrow>
\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sqbrac{f(a_n)-f(x_0)}g(x_0)}{a_n-x_0} = f'(x_0)g(x_0),

 Similarly

<title>Chain rule</title>
<statement>
 Let <m>f : (a,b) \to (c,d)</m> and <m>g:  (c,d) \to \R</m>.
 Suppose that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m> and that <m>g</m> is differentiable at <m>f(x_0)</m>.
 Then the composition <m>g\circ f</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m>.
 Moreover the derivative satisfies the identity
<me>
(g\circ f)'(x_0) = g'\bigbrac{f(x_0)} \cdot f'(x_0).

</statement>
<proof>
 Let <m>(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a sequence in <m>(a,b) \setminus\set{x_0}</m> with <m>x_n \to x_0</m>.
 By <xref ref="prop-seq-diff"/>, we wish to prove that
<men xml:id="eq-chain-to-prove">
\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{x_n-x_0} = g'\bigbrac{f(x_0)}f'(x_0).
</men>
 We have
<men xml:id="eq-chain-alt">
\frac{g\bigbrac{f( x_n)} - g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{ x_n-x_0} = 
\begin{cases}
0, \amp \text{if } f( x_n) = f(x_0);\\

\end{cases}
</men> 
<p>
First, let us suppose that <m>f(x_n) = f(x_0)</m> for only finitely many values of <m>n</m>.
 Then there exists <m>N_0\in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N_0</m> we have <m>f(x_n)\neq f(x_0)</m>.
 Hence for all <m>n \geq N_0</m> we have
<me>
\frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{x_n-x_0} = \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}\cdot \frac{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}{x_n-x_0} . 
</me>
 Since differentiability implies continuity (<xref ref="prop-diff-cts"/>), we have 
<me>
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x_0).
</me>
 Thus by the sequential characterisation of differentiability (<xref ref="prop-seq-diff"/>) we have
<men xml:id="eq-comp-subseq">
\lim_{\substack{n\to \infty\\ n \geq N_0}} \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{f(x_n)-f(x_0)} = g'\bigbrac{f(x_0)}.
</men>
 We may therefore use the multiplication rule for sequential limits (<xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>) to deduce that 
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{x_n-x_0} \amp = \lim_{\substack{n\to \infty\\ n \geq N_0}}\brac{ \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_n)}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}\cdot \frac{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}{x_n-x_0}}

 Next, let us suppose that <m>f(x_n)  = f(x_0)</m> for infinitely many values of <m>n</m>.
 Write <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  \dots</m> for those indices for which  <m>f(x_{k_n}) = f(x_0)</m>.
 Write <m>\ell_1 \lt  \ell_2 \lt  \dots</m> for the (possibly finite) remaining indices with <m>f(x_{l_n}) \neq f(x_0)</m>.
 The sequence
<men xml:id="eq-g-frac-bd">
n\mapsto \frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_{\ell_n})}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{f(x_{\ell_n})-f(x_0)}
</men>
is either a finite sequence, or converges as in the proof of <xref ref="eq-comp-subseq"/>.
 In either case, the sequence is bounded, so there exists <m>M \in \R</m> such that for all <m>\ell_n</m> we have
<me>
\abs{\frac{g\bigbrac{f(x_{\ell_n})}-g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{f(x_{\ell_n})-f(x_0)}
} \leq M.
</me>
 Combining this with <xref ref="eq-chain-alt"/>, for any <m>n \in \N</m> we have
<men xml:id="eq-alt-chain-ineq">
\abs{\frac{g\bigbrac{f( x_n)} - g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{ x_n-x_0}} \leq M\abs{\frac{f(x_{n}) - f(x_0)}{x_{n} - x_0}}.
</men>
 Since <m>x_{k_n} \to x_0</m> we have 
<me>
f'(x_0) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x_{k_n}) - f(x_0)}{x_{k_n} - x_0} = 0.
</me>
 So it follows that
<me>
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x_{n}) - f(x_0)}{x_{n} - x_0} = f'(x_0) = 0.
</me>
 Combining this with <xref ref="eq-alt-chain-ineq"/> gives
<me>
\lim_{n\to \infty}\abs{\frac{g\bigbrac{f( x_n)} - g\bigbrac{f(x_0)}}{ x_n-x_0}} = 0.
</me>
 Hence <xref ref="eq-chain-to-prove"/> also follows in this case.

<title>Quotient rule</title>
<statement>
 Let <m>f,g : (a,b) \to \R</m> both be differentiable at <m>x_0 \in D</m>.
 Suppose that <m>g(x_0) \neq 0</m>.
 Then the quotient <m>f/g</m> is defined on <m>(x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)</m> for some <m>\delta \gt 0</m> and is differentiable at <m>x_0</m>.
 Moreover the derivative satisfies the identity
<men xml:id="eq-quotient">
(f/g)'(x_0) = \frac{f'(x_0)g(x_0)-f(x_0)g'(x_0)}{g(x_0)^2}.
</men>
</statement>
<proof>
 Since differentiability implies continuity (<xref ref="prop-diff-cts"/>), the function <m>g</m> is continuous at <m>x_0</m>.
 Since <m>g(x_0) \neq 0</m>, and non-zero points of continuity yield a non-zero neighbourhood (<xref ref="cor-non-zero-cts"/>), there exists <m>\delta \gt0</m>  such that <m>g(x) \neq 0</m> for all <m>x \in  (a,b)\cap (x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)</m>. Decreasing <m>\delta</m> if necessary, we may assume that <m> (x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)\subset (a,b)</m>.
 Hence the quotient <m>x \mapsto f(x)/g(x)</m> is defined on <m>(x_0-\delta, x_0+\delta)</m>.
 Composing the reciprocal function <m>y \mapsto 1/y</m> with <m>g</m>, the chain rule (<xref ref="thm-chain-rule"/>) and <xref ref="eg-recip-diff"/> together give that the function 
<me>
x\mapsto \recip{g(x)}
</me>
is differentiable at <m>x_0</m>. 
 Moreover, the derivative satisfies
<me>
\brac{\recip{g(x_0)}}' = -\frac{g'(x_0)}{g(x_0)^2}.
</me>
 Hence by the product rule (<xref ref="prop-alg-diff"/>) the quotient <m>f/g = f \cdot\brac{1/g}</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m> with derivative
<me>
\frac{f'(x_0)}{g(x_0)} - \frac{f(x_0)g'(x_0)}{g(x_0)^2}.
</me> 
 This completes the proof of the quotient rule.

<title>Polynomials and rational functions are differentiable</title>
 Since the identity function <m>x \mapsto x</m> is differentiable on <m>\R</m>, the product rule gives that <m>x \mapsto x^2</m> is differentiable on <m>\R</m>.
 Using induction and the product rule, it follows that the for any <m>n \in \N</m> the function <m>x \mapsto x^n = x\cdot x^{n-1}</m> is differentiable on <m>\R</m> with derivative
<me>
(x^n)' = nx^{n-1}.
</me>
 Since constant functions <m>x \mapsto c</m> are differentiable on <m>\R</m>, with zero derivative, it follows from the product rule that the function <m>x \mapsto c x^n</m> is differentiable on <m>\R</m> with derivative
<me>
(cx^n)' = nc x^{n-1}.
</me>
 By the addition rule for differentiation (<xref ref="prop-alg-diff"/>) it follows that any polynomial

x \mapsto c_0  + c_1 x + \dots + c_n x^n
</me>
is differentiable on <m>\R</m>, with derivative
<me>
c_1  + 2c_2x + \dots + n c_n x^{n-1}.
</me>
 By the quotient rule for differentiation (<xref ref="cor-quotient"/>) we deduce that any rational function (see <xref ref="def-rational"/>) is differentiable on its domain of definition.

 Let us suppose that <m>x_0</m> is a local maximum for <m>f</m>; the argument for the local minimum is similar.

 Let <m>f : [a,b] \to \R</m> be a continuous function which is differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>, with <m>a \lt  b</m>.
 Suppose that <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.
 Then there exists <m>x_0 \in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f'(x_0) = 0</m>.

<proof>
By the extreme value theorem (<xref ref="thm-extreme"/>), there exists <m>x_1,x_2 \in [a,b]</m> which are minima and maxima (respectively) for <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>.
 In particular <m>x_1</m> is a local maximum and <m>x_2</m> is a local minimum.
 If <m>x_1 \in (a,b)</m> or <m>x_2 \in (a,b)</m>, then it follows that <m>f'(x_1) = 0</m> or <m>f'(x_2) = 0</m> since local minima/maxima have zero derivative at points of differentiability (<xref ref="lem-zero-deriv"/>).

 For any <m>x \in [a,b]</m>, we have that <m>f(x)</m> is between <m>f(x_1)</m> and <m>f(x_2)</m>.

 We deduce this result from Rolle's theorem (<xref ref="lem-rolle"/>).
 The idea of the proof is to try and find a continuous function <m>g:[a,b] \to \R</m> which is differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> with <m>g(a) = g(b)</m> and such that the identity <m>g'(x_0) = 0</m> implies <xref ref="eq-mvt"/>.
 To this end set

g(x) :=f(x) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} (x-a), \qquad (x \in [a,b]).
</me>
 This is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> since constant functions are continuous (<xref ref="eg-const-cts"/>), the identity function is continuous (<xref ref="eg-id-cts"/>) and so is the sum/product of continuous functions (<xref ref="prop-alg-cts"/>).
 The function <m>g</m> is differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> since constant functions are differentiable (<xref ref="eg-const-diff"/>), the identity function is differentiable (<xref ref="eg-id-diff"/>) and so is the sum/product of differentiable functions (<xref ref="prop-alg-cts"/>).
 We have <m>g(a) = f(a)</m> and <m>g(b)  = f(a)</m>.
 We may therefore apply Rolle's theorem to deduce the existence of <m>x_0 \in (a,b)</m> such that <m>g'(x_0) = 0</m>.
 Employing the sum/product rules for differentiation, we have that
<me>
g'(x_0) = f'(x_0) -\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.

 The result follows on re-arranging the identity

We do this by induction on <m>n \geq 0</m>, the base case <m>n=0</m> being automatic. Suppose then that <xref ref="eq-taylor-to-prove"/> holds for <m>n-1</m>, so that there exists <m>x_{n-1}</m> between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x</m> such that
<me>
\abs{g(x)} \leq |x-x_0|^{n-1} \abs{g^{(n-1)}(x_{n-1})}.
</me>
Applying the mean value theorem to <m>g^{(n-1)}</m>, there exists <m>x_{n}</m> between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x_{n-1}</m> such that
<me>
g^{(n-1)}(x_{n-1}) = g^{(n-1)}(x_{0}) + (x_{n-1}-x_0) g^{(n)}(x_n) = (x_{n-1}-x_0) g^{(n)}(x_n).
</me>
Since <m>x_{n-1}</m> is between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x</m>, we must have that <m>x_{n}</m> is between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x</m> and
<me>
|x_{n-1}-x_0|\leq |x-x_0|
</me>.
Therefore
<me>
\abs{g(x)} \leq |x-x_0|^{n-1} \abs{(x_{n-1}-x_0) g^{(n)}(x_n)} \leq |x-x_0|^{n} \abs{g^{(n)}(x_n)},
</me>
as required.

<title>Inverse function theorem</title>
<statement>
 Let <m>f: (a,b) \to (c,d)</m> be a bijective function and let  <m>x_0 \in (a,b)</m>. Suppose that <m>f^{-1}</m> is continuous at <m>y_0:=f(x_0)</m> and that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m> with

f'(x_0) \neq 0.

<men xml:id="eq-inv-formula">
\brac{f^{-1}}'(y_0) = \recip{f'(x_0)}.
</men>
</statement>
<proof>
By the sequential characterisation of differentiability (<xref ref="prop-seq-diff"/>), we are required to prove that if <m>(y_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence in <m>(c,d)\setminus\set{y_0}</m> with <m>y_n \to y_0</m>, then
<me>
\frac{f^{-1}(y_n) - f^{-1}(y_0)}{y_n-y_0} \to \recip{f'(x_0)}.
</me>
 Since <m>f</m> is bijective, for each <m>y_n\in (c,d)\setminus\set{y_0}</m> there exists <m>x_n \in (a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m> such that <m>f(x_n) = y_n</m>.
 Thus <m>(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence in <m>(a,b)\setminus\set{x_0}</m>.
 Since <m>f^{-1}</m> is continuous at <m>y_0</m> we have
<me>
x_n = f^{-1}(y_n) \to f^{-1}(y_0) = x_0.
</me>
 Since <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x_0</m>, it follows that
<me>
\frac{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}{x_n-x_0} \to f'(x_0).
</me>
 Since <m>f'(x_0) \neq 0</m>, it follows from the reciprocal rule for limits (<xref ref="prop-recip-rule"/>) that 
<me>
\frac{f^{-1}(y_n)-f^{-1}(y_0)}{y_n-y_0} = \frac{x_n-x_0}{f(x_n)-f(x_0)}\to \recip{f'(x_0)}.

				<title>Differentiability of power series</title>

					<solution>
					<theorem xml:id="cor-power-diff">
					<title>Power series are infinitely differentiable within radius of convergence</title>
					<statement>
 Let <m>(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty</m> be a sequence of real numbers.
 Let <m>R \in [0, \infty]</m> denote the radius of convergence (see <xref ref="thm-radius"/>) of the corresponding power series:
<men xml:id="eq-power-fn-2">
f(x) := \sum_{n =0}^\infty a_n x^n.
</men>
 Then for any <m>m \in \Z_{\geq0}</m> the function <m>f : (-R, R) \to \R</m> given by <xref ref="eq-power-fn-2"/> is <m>m</m>-times differentiable.
 Moreover, for any <m>x_0 \in (-R, R)</m> we have the formula
<men xml:id="eq-nth-power-deriv">
f^{(m)}(x_0) = \sum_{n = m}^\infty n(n-1)\dotsm (n-m+1)a_n x_0^{n-m}
</men>
where the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-nth-power-deriv"/> is absolutely convergent.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
 We prove the result for <m>m=1</m> and note that the general case then follows by re-applying the <m>m=1</m> case <m>m</m> times.
 </p>
<p>
In proving the <m>m=1</m> case, let us first show that the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-nth-power-deriv"/> is absolutely convergent. 
 Let <m>r</m> be a real number satisfying 
 <m>|x_0| \lt  r \lt  R</m>.
 Such a number exists since <m>|x_0| \lt  R</m>, for instance we could set
 <me>
 r:=\frac{|x_0|+R}{2}
 </me>.
 We claim that the following infinite series is  convergent
<men xml:id="eq-squared-series">
\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 |a_n| r^{n-2}.
</men>
 To see this, let <m>r_1</m> be a real satisfying <m>r \lt  r_1 \lt  R</m>.
 Then 
<me>
\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 |a_n| r^{n-2} \leq r^{-2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 (r/r_1)^n |a_n| r_1^n.
</me> 
 Since exponentials beat polynomials (<xref ref="prop-exp-poly"/>), we have that <m>n^2 (r/r_1)^n \to 0</m>, in particular the sequence <m>n^2 (r/r_1)^n</m> is bounded.
 It follows from the comparison test (<xref ref="prop-oh-test"/>) and absolute convergence of <xref ref="eq-power-fn-2"/> that <xref ref="eq-squared-series"/> converges.
 Again by the comparison test (<xref ref="prop-oh-test"/>), this implies absolute convergence of
<me>
\sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
With the above facts on absolute convergence established, we are able to prove the <m>m=1</m> case of <xref ref="eq-nth-power-deriv"/>. By linearity of series (<xref ref="prop-lin-series"/>), for <m>x \in [-r,r]</m> with <m>x\neq x_0</m> we have
<me>
\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x-x_0} - \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n x_0^{n-1} 
 = \recip{x-x_0}\sum_{n=2}^\infty a_n \sqbrac{x^n-x_0^n-(x-x_0)nx_0^{n-1}}
 </me>.
 By Taylor's theorem (<xref ref="thm-taylor"/>), for each <m>n\in \N</m> there exists <m>x_n</m> between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x</m> such that
 <me>
 \abs{x^n-x_0^n-(x-x_0)nx_0^{n-1}} \leq n(n-1)|x-x_0|^2|x_n|^{n-2}\leq n^2|x-x_0|^2r^{n-2}
 </me>.
 Therefore
 <me>
\abs{\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x-x_0} - \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n x_0^{n-1}}
 \leq \abs{x-x_0}\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2|a_n|r^{n-2}
 </me>.
 It follows that <xref ref="def-differentiable"/> is satisfied on taking
 <me>
 \delta(x_0, \eps) := \min\set{\frac{\eps}{\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2|a_n|r^{n-2}}, r-|x_0|} \gt 0
 </me>.

			In this week's <em>workshop</em> you will be asked to write-up (under exam conditions) two of the following:

					This question is a variant of <xref ref="ex-alg-diff"/>. Let <m>f,g :\R\to\R</m> be functions which are both differentiable at 0 with <m>f'(0)=1</m> and <m>g'(0)=0</m>.

					</li>
					<li>
					This question is a variant of <xref ref="ex-mono-diff"/>. Let <m>f,g:[0,1]\to \R</m> be continuous functions which are differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. Suppose that <m>f'(x) \geq g'(x)</m> for all <m>x\in[0,1]</m>. Use the mean value theorem to prove that <m>f(1) + g(0) \geq f(0) + g(1)</m>.

					This question is a variant of <xref ref="ex-taylor"/>. Let <m>f:\R\to\R</m> be a function which is <m>n</m>-times differentiable and suppose that

					f(0) = f'(0) = \dots = f^{(n-1)}(0)=0

					Without using the statement of Taylor's theorem, but by modifying the proof, prove that for all <m>x\gt 0</m> there exists <m>x_n \in (0,x)</m> such that

					\abs{f(x)} \leq x^n \abs{f^{(n)}(x_n)}.
