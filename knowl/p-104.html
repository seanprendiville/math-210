<p>Here is how I suggest that you work through the self-test questions:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Attempt the self-test questions in the order in which they are presented. Almost immediately, it is likely that you will  find yourself unsure about what you are writing. That is okay! For example, if trying to define a uniformly continuous function , you may begin: <blockquote class="blockquote">We say that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is uniformly continuous if <span class="process-math">\((\forall \eps &gt; 0)\dots\)</span> ??</blockquote> As you are writing this, some questions may occur to you: What should the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> be? What about the co-domain? What comes after <span class="process-math">\((\forall \eps &gt;0)\text{?}\)</span> Is it <span class="process-math">\((\exists \delta &gt; 0)\)</span> or is it <span class="process-math">\((\forall x,y\dots)\text{?}\)</span>
</li>
<li><p>As soon as you are stuck, you should look at the solution, reading until your query is answered.</p></li>
<li><p>Once your query is answered, cover up the solution and resume answering the self-test question. It is likely that you will shortly find yourself stuck once more. That is okay - simply repeat the above procedure!</p></li>
<li><p>Proceeding in this manner, one ends up reading the notes (which are in effect, the solutions to the questions) in detail, but when one does engage with the details, one is primed to understand and remember them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">You may choose to copy down what I write on the board in lectures, in order to compile your own booklet of "examinable lecture notes".</p>
