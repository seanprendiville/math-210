<p><em class="emphasis">90-120 minutes:</em> Your tutor will select one of the remaining two exam-style self-test questions and you will write-up a solution under exam conditions. The purpose of this is for you to receive  feedback on how to improve your answers in real analysis.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>The question should take you at most 20 minutes - the extra   time is  for those who require this in exams. However, everyone should feel free to use the extra time if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not consult anyone else during the final 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>You must include full details of your proofs and calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>The only results which you may use without further justification are those contained in the notes or other course materials, provided that you clearly paraphrase them.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are finished, you should hand your attempt to your workshop tutor and leave quietly.</p></li>
<li><p>Please include your name on your submission.</p></li>
