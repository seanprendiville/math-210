<div class="para">We will consider few, if any, "calculation" questions. This is because our learning outcomes (see above) are concerned with becoming fluent in the  rigour and logic required to articulate definitions and proofs in analysis, they are not about performing computations. Unfortunately, this is also one of the reasons why analysis can be hard to learn, at least initially. There are a number of reasons why it is important to become proficient in this rigour and logic:</div>
<ul class="disc">

<li><div class="para">Many of your future modules in mathematics build on the foundation laid down in real analysis: learning this foundation now makes your future courses <em class="emphasis">much</em> easier.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">As a mathematician, you should want to know whether you have proved something or not: if one believes one has proved the Riemann hypothesis<a class="xref" id="fn-17" href="" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17.html" title="Footnote D.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> then one would like to be able to check your argument before telling the world about it.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In order to understand your ideas, other mathematicians need to be able to read and verify your work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In your future work, your employer may hire you on your ability as a mathematician to construct logical arguments.</div></li>
