<div class="para">I believe it is more beneficial to your learning to <em class="emphasis">write</em> out answers to self-test questions, rather than reading lecture notes. Here are some reasons why I believe this:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">You have seen the majority of this material before, in MATH111-114. Sometimes our definitions will differ from those given in MATH111-114, see for instance our definition of "upper Riemann integral"  This often happens in mathematics<a class="xref" id="fn-10" href="" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10.html" title="Footnote C.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>; no confusion should arise provided that one is consistent. In this course, the examinable definition is that given in the solutions to the self-test questions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Mathematics is <em class="emphasis">hard</em> to read and to listen to. It is much more fun to write-up mathematics oneself, as this active process is closer to the puzzle-solving which draws many of us to the subject.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Evidence from educational psychology suggests that we understand and remember material more effectively if we first <em class="emphasis">get it wrong</em>. That is to say, we obtain better learning outcomes if we attempt a question, get it wrong, look up the solution, then write-up a correct answer.</div></li>
