<p>It is better to get a sense of what is being discussed in the solutions, then challenge yourself to write-up the precise mathematics yourself. You will almost always have to immediately consult the solution again. However, when you read mathematics <em class="emphasis">after</em> trying to write it yourself,  you are far more primed to engage with the details. It is like reading the solution to a problem you are stuck on - you really see what you were missing if you have tried the problem first.  Often one  reads until one spots the information previously missed or misunderstood, then has another attempt at writing-up.</p>
