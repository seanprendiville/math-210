</h3>Attempt the self-test questions in the order in which they are presented. Almost immediately, it is likely that you will  find yourself unsure about what you are writing. That is okay! For example, if trying to define a uniformly continuous function , you may begin: <blockquote class="blockquote">We say that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is uniformly continuous if <span class="process-math">\((\forall \eps &gt; 0)\dots\)</span> ??</blockquote> As you are writing this, some questions may occur to you: What should the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> be? What about the co-domain? What comes after <span class="process-math">\((\forall \eps &gt;0)\text{?}\)</span> Is it <span class="process-math">\((\exists \delta &gt; 0)\)</span> or is it <span class="process-math">\((\forall x,y\dots)\text{?}\)</span></article><span class="incontext"><a href="study-instructions.html#li-66" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
