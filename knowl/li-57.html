<p><em class="emphasis">Participation in Workshops</em>. Worth <span class="process-math">\(30\%\)</span> of your final mark. Workshops take place every fortnight, in odd-numbered weeks (see your timetable for details of where and when). Each workshop therefore counts towards <span class="process-math">\(6\%\)</span> of your final mark. Your mark for each workshop is scored out of 3. You will receive 1 mark for each of the following:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Group mark</em>. Your tutor will assign all members of your group 1 mark if your group:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p>writes up an answer to the self-test question assigned by your tutor for the group activity;</p></li>
<li><p>provides a mark and feedback to another group.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Individual mark</em>.  This assesses your participation in the group activities and the true/false quiz. Your tutor will assign you 1 mark if you demonstrate your ability to discuss new mathematical ideas with your peers or tutors.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Mark for self-test submission</em>. Your tutor will assign you 1 mark if you submit a reasonable attempt at the exam-style self-test question which your tutor asks you to complete at the end of the workshop. If you are unable to answer this question, you will still receive 1 mark if your submission clearly explains the unsuccessful strategies you have attempted. You will not receive a mark if you do not attempt the question and do not explain the strategies attempted.</p></li>
