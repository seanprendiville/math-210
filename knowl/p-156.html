<em class="emphasis">Memorisation versus reconstruction:</em> One can memorise every proof in this course for the purpose of the exam, however this is not a good idea for the following reasons:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">We have limited memory, and it is therefore very hard to memorise such a large amount of information<a class="xref" id="fn-14" href="" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-14.html" title="Footnote C.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Mathematicians are lazy - most of us do not like memorising large amounts of material. Successful mathematicians learn a few strategies which allow them to reconstruct  proofs from first principles. On occasion one has to memorise a key "trick" or "idea", which it may be hard to think of yourself (particularly under exam conditions). However, memorising a handful of key "tricks" is much easier than memorising 100 pages of notes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Our intended learning outcomes (see <a href="module-purpose.html" class="internal" title="Appendix D: \ The purpose of this module">Appendix D</a>) of "writing proofs" and "constructing counterexamples" are not met through memorisation. These learning outcomes are  skills which can be acquired, and are useful in other situations, in mathematics and beyond.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In your assessment, you will be given statements to prove which are similar but not identical to those in the notes. Understanding how to construct a proof allows you to answer these questions, whereas memorising the proofs in the notes does not.</div></li>
